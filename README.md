# SEISMIC-RNA Paper

This git repository contains

- the manuscript text and figures
- scripts that were used to
    - download data for parameterization
    - determine the empirical distribution of mutation gaps
    - determine the empirical mutation rates
    - simulate data for benchmarking
    - run SEISMIC-RNA, DanceMapper, DRACO, and DREEM
    - analyze the results and make the figures
- simulated references, structures, and parameters (FASTQ files and program outputs are very large and thus not included here)
